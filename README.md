# data-analyticspf
Hi, I'm Celine. 👋 An aspiring data analyst based in MY. 

In this repository, I experiment with various data analytics-related ideas, from coding to data visualization. 🧪

By day, I crunch numbers as a performance specialist. 🔎 After hours, I dive into coding and data fun (for the hell of it!). 💻

Borderline adhd, super curious and creative. I also love diving, reading a trip. 🚀✨
